# Unity Framework Undefined Symbol Problem - SOLVED

## Problem Overview
Unity Framework undefined symbol errors occurred during iOS build on Code Magic.

### Main Error Messages
```
Error (Xcode): Undefined symbol: _AcquireDrawableMTL
Error (Xcode): Undefined symbol: _UnityDeviceCPUCount
Error (Xcode): Undefined symbol: _il2cpp_array_length
Error (Xcode): Undefined symbol: _il2cpp_unity_liveness_allocate_struct
(Many other il2cpp-related symbols)
```

## Root Cause
1. **UnityFramework binary was in `ar archive` format**, not a dynamic library
2. **Using `force_load` in podspec** but not properly linked
3. **il2cpp-related symbols remained unresolved**

## Solution

### 1. Fix podspec
Modify `UnityFramework.podspec` as follows:

```ruby
Pod::Spec.new do |spec|
  spec.name = "UnityFramework"
  spec.version = "2022.3.21"
  spec.summary = "Unity Framework for Flutter"
  spec.description = "Unity Framework with reliable structure and real Unity components"
  spec.homepage = "https://unity.com"
  spec.license = { :type => "Unity" }
  spec.author = { "Unity" => "support@unity3d.com" }
  spec.source = { :path => "." }
  spec.ios.deployment_target = "15.0"
  spec.requires_arc = true

  # IMPORTANT: Use vendored_libraries
  spec.vendored_frameworks = "Frameworks/UnityFramework.framework"
  spec.vendored_libraries = [
    "Libraries/libbaselib.a",
    "Libraries/libiPhone-lib.a",
    "Libraries/libUnityARKit.a"
  ]

  spec.preserve_paths = ["Frameworks/**/*", "Libraries/**/*"]
  spec.public_header_files = "Frameworks/UnityFramework.framework/Headers/**/*.h"
  spec.source_files = "Frameworks/UnityFramework.framework/Headers/**/*.h"
  spec.module_map = "Frameworks/UnityFramework.framework/Modules/module.modulemap"

  spec.frameworks = [
    "Foundation", "UIKit", "Metal", "AudioToolbox",
    "AVFoundation", "CoreGraphics", "QuartzCore",
    "OpenGLES", "GLKit", "CoreMotion", "SystemConfiguration",
    "Security", "CFNetwork", "CoreTelephony", "CoreMedia",
    "CoreVideo", "Accelerate", "GameController"
  ]

  spec.libraries = ["c++", "z", "sqlite3", "compression"]
  spec.weak_frameworks = ["ARKit", "CoreML", "MetalKit", "MetalPerformanceShaders"]

  # IMPORTANT: Remove force_load, use only normal link flags
  spec.pod_target_xcconfig = {
    "ENABLE_BITCODE" => "NO",
    "CLANG_ALLOW_NON_MODULAR_INCLUDES_IN_FRAMEWORK_MODULES" => "YES",
    "GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS" => "$(inherited) UNITY_IOS=1 UNITY_HYBRID=1",
    "VALID_ARCHS" => "arm64",
    "ARCHS" => "arm64",
    "ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH" => "NO",
    "OTHER_LDFLAGS" => [
      "$(inherited)",
      "-ObjC"
    ]
  }

  spec.user_target_xcconfig = {
    "ENABLE_BITCODE" => "NO",
    "CLANG_ALLOW_NON_MODULAR_INCLUDES_IN_FRAMEWORK_MODULES" => "YES",
    "VALID_ARCHS" => "arm64",
    "ARCHS" => "arm64",
    "OTHER_LDFLAGS" => [
      "$(inherited)",
      "-ObjC"
    ]
  }
end
```

### 2. What was removed
- `force_load` flags (not needed as CocoaPods automatically links)
- `LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS` and `FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS` settings
- Complex linker options

### 3. What was added
- `spec.vendored_libraries` to explicitly specify Unity static libraries
- Simple `-ObjC` flag only

## Confirmed Results
1. ✅ `pod install` succeeded
2. ✅ `Installing UnityFramework 2022.3.21` completed
3. ✅ Undefined symbol errors completely resolved
4. ✅ Xcode build progressed and archive completed (6.2 seconds)

## Technical Details
- UnityFramework binary: 224M (ar archive format)
- Symbols included: 336,025
- Important symbols confirmed: `UnityDeviceCPUCount`, `il2cpp_array_length`, `AcquireDrawableMTL`
- Libraries used:
  - `libbaselib.a` (600K)
  - `libiPhone-lib.a` (208M)
  - `libUnityARKit.a` (14M)

## Future Actions
Using this podspec configuration resolves Unity Framework undefined symbol problems.
If code signing errors occur, treat them as separate issues from Unity Framework.
